6.8 Chapter summary
Motion capture is a very powerful and useful tool. It will never replace the results produced by a skilled animator, but its role in animation will expand and increase as motion libraries are built and the techniques to modify, combine, and adapt motion capture data become more sophisticated. Current research involves extracting motion capture data from markerless video. This has the potential to free subject from instrumentation constraints and make motion capture even more useful.
