Three general approaches to motion control

* artistic animation: Crafting the motion, foundation is interpolation.
* data-driven animation, live motion is digitized and then mapped onto graphical objects.
* procedural animation, there is a computational moduel that is used to control the motion.

There are actually two rates of concern, One is the playback or refresh rate. The other is the sampling or update rate.

1.3.1 Principles of animation

* Simulating physics
* Designing aesthetically pleasing actions
* Effectivly presenting action
* Production technique
