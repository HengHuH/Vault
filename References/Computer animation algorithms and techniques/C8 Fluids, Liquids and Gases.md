8.3 Chapter summay
Most of the techniques discussed in this chapter are still the subject of research efforts. Water, smoke, clouds, and fire share an amorphous nature, which makes them difficult to model and animate. Approaches that incorporate a greater amount of physics have been developed recently for these phenomena. As processing power becomes cheapter, techniques such as CFD become more practical tools for animating water and gas, but convenient controls for such models have yet to be develped.
